In fact, if you are connecting to the internet through your own laptop we would recommend using a VPN client for secure access to company intranets and mail servers. Check that your company VPN supports NAT traversal and allows multiple connections from a single IP address. Check with your IT staff. Please ensure that you are logged in through the portal page before you use your VPN.
